An object icon is used to represent an Atlassian-specific content type.

## Sizing

### Small

Use the small size when space is at a premium. Elements in this icon are simplified, rearranged or filled in because there is significantly less space. This icon is designed on a 16px grid and uses 1px strokes. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';



import NewFeature16Icon from '@atlaskit/icon-object/glyph/new-feature/16';



export default () => <NewFeature16Icon label="" />;
```

### Medium

The medium size (24px) is used in common interfaces. This icon is designed on a 20px grid (on 24px artboard) and uses 2px strokes. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';



import NewFeature24Icon from '@atlaskit/icon-object/glyph/new-feature/24';



export default () => <NewFeature24Icon label="" />;
```
